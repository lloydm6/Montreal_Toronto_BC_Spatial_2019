# Montreal_Toronto_BC_Spatial_2019
Summer 2019 Practicum, data collected the previous year

Merged the outcomes and determinants. Plotted a bunch of histograms just to get a feel for the data

Ran all the univariate regressions

Made a nice csv output for the regressions....nice in my opinion. 

Ran TO summer unis

xy fit plots for TO and MTL summer. Ran uni regs and plots with outliers removed. 

Added pooled. No pooled plots.

Added Montreal Winter (reg plus plots). Set up Montreal Annual data, but haven't done plots yet
